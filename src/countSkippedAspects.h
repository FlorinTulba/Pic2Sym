/**
Square patches from an image must be approximated by some fonts of the same size.
The approximation takes into account several matching aspects.
The process investigates all fonts to find the best match for a given image patch.
The score of the best known match is compared against the score of each following
font.
However, when a symbol is a much worse match than the current best match,
only a few matching aspects will be enough to conclude the poor match.
The remaining matching aspects will be skipped.

Use MONITOR_SKIPPED_MATCHING_ASPECTS to count and report the skipped matching aspects
by category, together with their relative computational complexity.
