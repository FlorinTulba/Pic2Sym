/**
Square patches from an image must be approximated by some fonts of the same
size. The approximation takes into account several matching aspects. The process
investigates all fonts to find the best match for a given image patch. The score
of the best known match is compared against the score of each following font.
However, when a symbol is a much worse match than the current best match,
only a few matching aspects will be enough to conclude the poor match.
The remaining matching aspects will be skipped.

Use MONITOR_SKIPPED_MATCHING_ASPECTS to count and report the skipped matching
aspects by category, together with their relative computational complexity.
