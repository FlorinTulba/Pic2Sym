**Version 1.1** introduces the *hybrid approximation mode* to tackle the **problem of less\-inspired approximations** and reduces the *transformation time* for images with sufficient *uniform patches*.

- - -

*Next versions* should focus on *faster transformation*. Image and symbols preprocessing, parallelization of critical paths might be worth investigating.

Using larger symbol sets would be possible only by removing some undesired glyphs and clustering the rest, or performing the transformation using GPUs power and parallelization.

Images could also collect some patch statistics at the start of transformation and thus direct better the selection of appropriate symbols.
