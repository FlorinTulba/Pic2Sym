## Testing Pic2Sym (with CUDA features) ##

[Back to start page](../../../ReadMe.md)

Since the features implemented so far with CUDA showed poor performance during the tests on [this old GPU](https://www.notebookcheck.net/NVIDIA-GeForce-9600M-GS.9450.0.html) I have decided to suggest using the non-CUDA version of the project until finding parts of the application more suitable for help even from older GPU-s.

For testing the CPU-only version follow the *Testing the application* link from [here](https://github.com/FlorinTulba/Pic2Sym).
