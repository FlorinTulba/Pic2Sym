A) Limitations of &#39;**highgui**&#39; library from *OpenCV 3.0.0*:

1. Apart from the Control Panel, OpenCV windows should not be closed neither with Alt+F4, nor with the mouse. I&#39;ve provided the *ESC* key mechanism to let the user leave the application

1. The rows of buttons from the Control Panel must be (vertically) separated by at least one slider

1. All OpenCV sliders need the values 0 and 1. Therefore these values might not make sense at times, or are associated with some special meaning
