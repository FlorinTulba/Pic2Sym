## Development environment configuration (Pic2Sym v2.0)

[Back to start page](../../../ReadMe.md)

----

Pic2Sym uses *Boost*, *OpenCV*, *FreeType* and *Zlib* (plus *TBB*, indirectly). Considerations:

- users might not have these programs installed on their machines
- the installation paths of those programs on several developers&#39; machines might differ

To deal with these possibilities, the project:

- provides all header files and libraries **strictly necessary** for compiling the *existing sources* of the project
- offers 3 configurable files ***[Common.props][Common]***, ***[Debug.props][Debug]*** and ***[Release.props][Release]*** useful when *extending the project*. Those files help specifying paths / suffixes for separately installed *Boost*, *OpenCV*, *FreeType*, *Zlib*, *TBB* products

To be able to compile the current sources:

1.	Download the repository files
1.	Copy ***[Common.props][Common]***, ***[Debug.props][Debug]*** and ***[Release.props][Release]*** from **[dev/][DevFolder]** folder to the solution folder
1.	Unpack ***include.zip*** and ***lib.zip*** (from **[dev/][DevFolder]** folder) to the solution folder
1.	Open the solution file and build it for **x64** platform (Debug or Release)
1.	\[*Optionally*\] Install with *Administrator rights* the free font file ***BPmonoBold.ttf*** from the **[res][ResFolder]**/ folder or from [here][BpMono], in order to be visible while running the application. This font family has less than 200 symbols and it might be ideal for a quick check of the application. Installing fonts requires just double-clicking the font file and then pressing **Install** button. Uninstalling steps: **Start** button; click **Run**; type &quot;**%windir%\\fonts**&quot;; Right click on desired font; Choose **Delete**.

To be able to extend the project, please install (any expected, but missing parts from) Boost / OpenCV / FreeType / Zlib / TBB and configure ***[Common.props][Common]***, ***[Debug.props][Debug]*** and ***[Release.props][Release]*** to refer to your separately installed products.

The project directory structure of the project might help when interested in extending it:

- **bin**/ contains:
	- ***Pic2Sym.msi*** with the *installer* of the application
    - ***DLLs***/ folder with the *required dll\-s*
    - ***agpl-3.0.txt*** - the *license* of the application
- **doc**/ contains following folders
	- **pages**/ with the *documentation of the project*
	- **examples**/ with various results generated by the Pic2Sym project
	- **licenses**/ with the *license files* from *Boost*, *FreeType*, *OpenCV* and *zlib*
- **[dev/][DevFolder]** contains following files (*generated by scripts*) needed during installation:
	- 3 *properties files* (***[Common.props][Common]***, ***[Debug.props][Debug]*** and ***[Release.props][Release]***) used by the 2 projects: Pic2Sym and UnitTesting
	- 2 *archives* ***include.zip*** and ***lib.zip*** that contain the *headers* and *libraries* needed by the 2 projects, except from those provided already by Windows and Visual Studio
- **[res][ResFolder]**/ contains:
	- the folder ***TestSymFilters***/ with the files used for testing the implemented symbol filters
    - 2 small free *font files* (***[BPmonoBold.ttf][BpMono]*** and ***vga855.fon***) used by Unit Tests
    - ***NoImage.jpg*** that appears when the application starts
    - ***defaultMatchSettings.txt*** \- configuration file used for the first start
	- ***varConfig.txt*** \- configurable constants controlling look and behavior of the application
- **src**/ contains the *sources* of the project
- **test**/ contains *Unit Test* files

The root folder contains also the *solution file*, *projects\-specific* files and the license file *agpl-3.0.txt*.
