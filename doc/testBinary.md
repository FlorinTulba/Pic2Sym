1. Download repository files
2. Choose a directory for this test (*TestDir*)
3. Unpack **launch/Pic2Sym.zip** in *TestDir*
4. Copy the whole **res/** folder (*together with the folder*) to *TestDir*
5. Launch ***TestDir*/Pic2Sym.exe**. If it starts, jump to **7**. For errors about *missing dll\-s*, continue below
6. Non\-development machines might not already have several *common dll-s*, so here are some links to download them in *TestDir*, if reported missing: [advapi32.dll](http://files.dllworld.org/advapi32.dll-6.3.9600.17031-64bit.zip), [msvcp120.dll](http://files.dllworld.org/msvcp120.dll-12.0.21005.1-64bit_3075.zip) or [msvcr120.dll](http://files.dllworld.org/msvcr120.dll-12.0.21005.1-64bit_3122.zip). *Make sure the application starts before continuing to **7***
7. *Optionally* install (*double\-clicking the file*) the free font *BpMono bold* from [here][1] or from  ***TestDir*/res/BpMonoBold.ttf** *to be sure your machine has at least one interesting font to work with*
8. Activate the main window and press **Ctrl\+P** to display the *Control Panel*. Now select an image to transform, then a font family to use and finally hit Transform. At the end of the transformation you&#39;ll be able to *inspect the result* with the *Transparency slider* from the main window
