; What percent (0..1) of the glyphs from a charmap set are considered small
; 0.1 means that smallest 10% of all glyphs are considered small
PmsCont_SMALL_GLYPHS_PERCENT	0.1

; Constant for background threshold
; 1/255 = 0.00392, so 0.004 tolerates pixels with 1 brightness unit less / more than ideal
; STILL_BG was set to 0, as there are font families with extremely similar glyphs.
; When Unit Testing shouldn't identify exactly each glyph, STILL_BG might be > 0.
; But testing on 'BPmonoBold.ttf' does tolerate such larger values (0.025, for instance).
MatchEngine_updateSymbols_STILL_BG	0.

; Blurred Patches with Contrast less than this value will become part of the result.
; No approximation will be performed for such patches.
; Max Contrast is 255.
Transformer_run_THRESHOLD_CONTRAST_BLURRED	7.

; Text for the Instructions dialog
ControlPanel_instructionsText	"The Control Panel allows setting:\n\n- which image to be approximated by symbols from a charset\n- maximum number of symbols used horizontally & vertically\n- which font family provides these symbols\n- the desired encoding within the selected font family\n- the size of these symbols\n- the result mode: normal or hybrid (cosmeticized version)\n- a factor to encourage structural similarity\n- factors to favor better correspondence of foreground\n   (under glyph) / contours (edges of the glyph) /\n   background (around, aside glyph)\n- a factor to encourage matching symbols with large contrast\n- a factor to encourage 'gravitational' smoothness\n   (match patch 'mass center')\n- a factor to enhance directionality (match patch 'gradient')\n- a factor to favor selecting larger symbols over small ones\n- the threshold contrast of determined matching glyphs below\n   which to replace these barely visible matches with Blanks\n\nThe rudimentary sliders used here won't always show valid ranges.\nThey all must be integer, start from 0, end at least on 1.\nWhen their labels is truncated, clicking on them will help."
