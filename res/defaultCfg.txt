; Height & width in pixels of each symbol
; Valid range: 7 .. 50
FONT_HEIGHT		10

; Maximum number of symbols on each row of the resulted image
; Valid range 3 .. 1024
RESULT_WIDTH	500

; Maximum number of symbols on each column of the resulted image
; Valid range 3 .. 768
RESULT_HEIGHT	300

; Threshold <x> below which to use Blank (Space) instead of a barely visible symbol.
; If a certain region gets approximated by a poorly visible character,
; that is when its foreground and background colors are less than <x> units apart,
; then it makes sense to directly use the Blank character using as its background
; the mean color of the represented region.
; For 3-channels images the sum of the 3 absolute differences between fg&bg
; needs to be less than 3*<x> to use the Blank replacement.
; Valid range: 0 .. 50
THRESHOLD_FOR_BLANK	0

; Real coefficient that penalizes extremely low contrast matches,
; favoring less accurate ones, but which will bring more contrast.
; Set it to 0 if correctness is more important than a fancy result.
; Any other real positive value is allowed. 1 is ok.
MORE_CONTRAST_PREF	3.0

; Real coefficient that might enforce choosing larger symbols, like an 'A' instead of 'i',
; even when they are less similar to the approximated area.
; Set it to 0 if correctness is more important than a fancy result.
; Any other real positive value is allowed. 1 is ok.
LARGER_GLYPHS_PREF	1.0

; Real coefficient that penalizes poor glyph matches when compared
; strictly to the region covered by the glyph's pixels
; Set it to 0 if it doesn't matter what lies under glyph's contour.
; Any other real positive value is allowed. 1 is ok.
UNDER_GLYPH_CORRECTNESS	1.0

; Real coefficient that penalizes poor background glyph matches when compared
; strictly to the region falling aside the glyph.
; Set it to 0 if it doesn't matter what lies aside the glyph.
; Any other real positive value is allowed. 1 is ok.
ASIDE_GLYPH_CORRECTNESS	1.0

; Real coefficient that favors glyphs naturally disposed in directions that
; simulate the color transition (gradient) from the original area to approximate.
; Set it to 0 if color transition directions don't matter.
; Any other real positive value is allowed. 1 is ok.
DIRECTIONAL_SMOOTHNESS	0.3

; Real coefficient that favors glyphs naturally disposed
; near the 'center of action' from the original area to approximate.
; Set it to 0 if chosen glyph can be far from the 'gravitational point' of the patch.
; Any other real positive value is allowed. 1 is ok.
GRAVITATIONAL_SMOOTHNESS	0.3
